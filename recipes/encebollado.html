    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Place the water and oil in a pot to boil and add 3 chopped tomatoes and half a paite単a onion,
            <br> add the celery, the pieces of pepper, 2 tablespoons of cilantro, garlic, cumin, salt, pepper and chili to dry.</p></li>
        <li><p>In another separate pot, cook the previously chopped cassava with plenty of water until soft.</p></li>
        <li><p>Separately, make the onion pickle with the remaining finely chopped paite単a onion, washed, drained, and seasoned with salt, lemon juice,<br>
             and the remaining chopped cilantro. Let it sit until it's cured.</p></li>
        <li><p> Add the albacore loins to the broth from step 1, cook them completely,
            <br> and remove from the pot once they are well cooked, approximately 10 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>After setting aside the cooked albacore, remove the vegetables from the broth and place them in a blender. Add a little cooked yuca and a little of the yuca cooking liquid,
            <br> blending until smooth. Strain the blended liquid over the broth in the pot and add the yuca cooking water.
            <br> Dissolve the MAGGI速 Vegetable Broth cubes. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes over medium heat. Return the albacore to the preparation.</p></li>
        <li><p>Season with salt and pepper. Place a small amount of soup with chunks of yuca and albacore<br>
             on the plate and serve with some of the onion pickle you prepared earlier.</p></li>
